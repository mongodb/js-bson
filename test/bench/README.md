# BSON benchmarking

This directory contains the files pertinent to performance testing of js-bson.

The `documents` directory contains generated documents used for performance testing

The `etc` directory contains scripts used to run benchmarks, generate benchmark documents and
process the results.

The `granular` directory contains files that test bson performance in a range of different
scenarios using the bson-bench library.

The `spec` directory contains one file used to run the performance tests mandated by the bson
microbenchmarking specification.


Granular tests can be run from the repository root by running:

```bash
WARMUP=<warmup iterations> ITERATIONS=<measured iterations> npm run check:granular-bench
```

This will build the granular tests and run them with `test/bench/etc/run_granular_benchmarks.js`. The `WARMUP` and `ITERATIONS` environment variables can be optionally provided to configure how these granular benchmarks
are run. `WARMUP` changes the number of iterations run before results are collected to give v8's
optimizing compiler time to reach steady state. `ITERATIONS` changes the number of iterations that
are measured and used to calculate summary statistics. Note also that the test can be configured to
make use of the local copy of bson when testing performance changes locally by setting the `LIBRARY`
variable to the root directory of the bson library to be tested.

```bash
WARMUP=100 ITERATIONS=1000 LIBRARY=$(pwd) npm run check:granular-bench
```
When the `LIBRARY` environment variable is unset, the benchmark clones and runs against the main
branch of this repository.

When the script is complete, results will be output to `test/bench/etc/resultsCollectedMeans.json`. These results will
be in a format compatible with evergreen's perf.send command. To convert these results to CSV, run
the following command from the repository root:

```bash
./test/bench/etc/convertToCSV.js < test/bench/etc/resultsCollectedMeans.json > resultsCollected.csv
```

Spec tests can be run from the repository root by running:

``` bash
npm run check:spec-bench
```

This will run the spec benchmarks in `test/bench/spec/bsonBench.ts` which also makes use of the
`bson-bench` library. Results will be written to `bsonBench`. The warmup and iterations are not
configurable as these are determined by the common driver benchmarking specification, but similar
to the granular benchmarks, the spec benchmarks can be run against the local copy of bson by setting
the `LIBRARY` environment variable appropriately.

```bash
LIBRARY=$(pwd) npm run check:spec-bench
```
